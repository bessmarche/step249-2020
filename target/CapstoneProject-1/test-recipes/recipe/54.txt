2. Transfer the butter-sugar mixture to a large mixing bowl and allow it to cool for 20 minutes. Once the mixture is cooled, whisk in the eggs and vanilla. In a separate bowl, combine the salt, flour, and baking powder. Add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, and stir just until combined. Stir in the chopped Snickers.
3. Chill the cookie dough for 15 minutes. Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 350Â°F and coat a whoopie pie pan with nonstick spray. Line each cavity with a parchment paper circle.
