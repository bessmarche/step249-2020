Ingredients:
For Cookie Base:
1 1/2 cups (190g) flour
2 teaspoons baking powder 
1/4 teaspoon salt
8 tablespoons (115g) unsalted butter, at room temperature
3/4 cup (150g) sugar
1 large egg, at room temperature
1/4 cup (60ml) whole milk

For Soft Gooey Layer:
1/4 cup Steen's cane syrup (or golden syrup)
1/4 cup whole milk 
1 tablespoon vanilla extract 
12 tablespoons unsalted butter, at room temperature 
1/2 cup sugar 
1/2 cup light brown sugar
1/4 teaspoon salt 
1 large egg, at room temperature 
1 1/4 (155g) cups flour

For Cinnamon Topping:
2 tablespoons sugar
1 1/2 teaspoons ground cinnamo

Steps:
Line a 9- by 13-inch cake pan with foil, leaving an overhang on all four sides. (I overturn the pan, shape the foil over the bottom, remove it, then flip the pan over and ease the foil into the pan.) Spray the foil in the pan with nonstick spray or brush with melted butter. <br />

Preheat the oven to 350ÂºF (180ÂºC).
Whisk together the 1 1/2 cups (190g) flour, baking powder, and 1/4 teaspoon salt in a small bowl. Beat the 8 tablespoons (115g) of butter and the 3/4 cup (150g) of sugar in the bowl of stand mixer with the paddle attachment, or by hand, until light and fluffy, 3 to 5 minutes.
Add the egg and the milk and mix in, stopping the mixer to scrape down the sides of the bowl. Stir in the dry ingredients, until fully incorporated. Put the mixture in the cake pan in dollops (itâs too thick to spread if you add it all in the same place), and spread it into an even layer with an offset spatula.  (You donât need to clean the bowl; you can reuse it for the next step.)
In a small bowl, whisk together the corn syrup or golden syrup with the milk or cream, and vanilla.
Beat the 12 tablespoons (170g) of butter with the 1 cup plus 2 tablespoons (225g) of sugar, and salt until light and fluffy. Beat in the egg, scraping down the sides of the bowl.
Add one-third of the 1 1/4 cup (155g) flour, then half of the milk/corn syrup mixture. Add another one-third of the flour, then the rest of the milk/corn syrup mixture. Then stir in the remaining flour. Dollop the batter over the unbaked cookie layer and spread evenly.
Mix together the 2 tablespoons of sugar and cinnamon, then sprinkle it evenly over the cake.
