Ingredients:
1 package prosciutto
1 avocado, sliced
4 slices provolone (I used reduced-fat)
4 tablespoons olive oil
2 roma tomatoes, sliced
1/4 red onion, sliced into thin strips
8 thick-cut slices fresh whole-grain bakery bread
1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantr

Steps:
In a medium skillet over medium heat, spray non-stick spray and fry 2-3 pieces of prosciutto at a time. Keep the full slices intact (a.k.a. avoid tearing). Fry on each side for about 2 minutes, and then transfer to a plate lined with paper towel. Repeat for all prosciutto pieces in the package.<br />

Once all prosciutto is fried, dump onions into the same pan (to get all of that yummy flavor!) and fry for a quick 1-2 minutes, or until slightly browned. Remove pan from heat and set aside.
Heat your panini-maker. (In our case, we have a Cuisinart Griddler -- but you might have a pan or just choose to fry your sandwiches if you don't have either.) While your panini-maker is heating up, assemble your sandwiches.
Lay all 8 pieces of bread out on a cutting board or baking sheet. Drizzle each piece with olive oil (about a 1/2 tablespoon or less); then flip each bread slice over and repeat. On four of the bread slices (your sandwich bases), pile on 2 pieces of prosciutto, 1 piece of provolone, avocado (enough to cover it up!), 3 slices of tomato and a few pieces of the onions. Top each sandwich base with a sprinkle of freshly chopped cilantro.
