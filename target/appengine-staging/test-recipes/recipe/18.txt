Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (or temperature specified on pizza dough package). Place pizza stone in oven (if you're using one).
Heat 1 Tablespoon olive oil over medium heat. Add prosciutto, kale, green onion and spices. Saute for 4-5 minutes or until prosciutto is crispy. Set aside.
Spread pizza dough into a circular shape on a large cutting board. Once oven is preheated, remove stone from oven and set on stove. Caution: it's HOT! Drizzle 1 Tablespoon olive oil on pizza stone. Carefully, transfer pizza dough to pizza stone. Add prosciutto, kale and onion mix. Top with mozzarella and then parmesan. Return pizza stone to oven and bake for 2 minutes.
Pull out oven rack (leaving the pizza stone on the rack), and crack eggs on top of pizza. Return oven rack to proper position and bake for 8-10 minutes.
