Ingredients:
3 tbsp olive oil, divided
 12 oz sweet apple chicken sausage (I used Al Fresco brand), diced
 4 cups frozen Southern-style diced potatoes, thawed
 1/2 tsp sea salt
 1/4 tsp black pepper
 3 scallions, sliced thin on the diagonal
 1 cup diced fresh mozzarella
 6 large eggs
 1/4 cup milk

Steps:
1) Preheat oven to 4oo degrees
2) To large skillet (I used cast iron) add 1 tbsp olive oil (reserving 2 tbsp) and heat over medium-high heat; add sausage and cook, stirring often, 5-6 minutes until browned; transfer sausage to a bowl and set aside
3) Add reserved 2 tbsp olive oil to skillet and heat over medium-high heat; add diced potatoes, salt, and pepper and cook, stirring often, 7-8 minutes until browned; remove from heat
4) Scatter sausage, scallions, and mozzarella over potatoes and set aside
5) In medium-sized bowl, lightly beat eggs with milk; pour over potato-sausage mixture; cover frittata with aluminum foil and bake in oven 20 minutes; remove foil and bake additional 12-15 minutes until eggs are set and frittata is golden brown; serve immediately; going, going, gone!
