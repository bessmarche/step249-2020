In a large, ovenproof skillet or saucepan, melt the butter over medium-high heat.  
Add peppers, onions, and mushrooms and sautÃ© until mushrooms are translucent and peppers and mushrooms are soft.  
Meanwhile, turn your oven broiler on low. 
Next add the leftover beef.  You can use raw beef if you want, too.  Saute for a minute or two.  
Then add the stock/broth, Worcestershire sauce, coconut aminos, and hot sauce.  Saute for a few minutes more. 
Now sprinkle some shredded cheese or lay some cheese slices atop the beef mixture.  Place in the oven under the broiler until the cheese is melted and slightly browned.
