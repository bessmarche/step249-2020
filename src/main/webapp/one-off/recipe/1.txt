Hamburger Corn and Pea Bake

Ingredients:
1 pound ground beef
 1/2 cup chopped onion 
 2 cups frozen corn
 1 cup frozen peas
 1 pint cream of mushroom soup
 1/2 - 3/4 cup shredded cheddar cheese
 1/2 - 3/4 cup milk
 1 1/2 cups egg noodles
 1/2 cup torn up bread or crusty bread
 1 Tablespoon butter, melted
 Salt and pepper to taste

Steps:
Bring a pot of water to a boil, salt it, and cook the noodles. I used some remaining store-bought egg noodles that I needed to use up, plus some homemade soaked whole wheat noodles. 
Meanwhile, cook the meat with onion until done. Stir in corn, peas, soup, cheese, and milk. I use homemade cream of mushroom soup. If you don't have homemade, you could use organic if you'd like, or else just add some extra milk, arrowroot powder, and your favorite seasonings. Mix well. Stir in noodles. 
Put in 2 qt. casserole dish. Mix bread and butter. Sprinkle on top. (I forgot the bread was supposed to go on top and I stirred it up in the mixture. Oops. I used crusty bread (like you'd use for stuffing) and it turned out really tasty.)
Bake at 350 for 45 min. - 1 hr., until hot and bubbly. Let sit for about 5 minutes before serving.
