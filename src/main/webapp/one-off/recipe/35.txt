Ingredients:
1/2 large red onion, sliced into thin strips
1-1 1/2 pkgs. prosciutto (we used about 1 &amp; 1/4 packages)
1 clove garlic, minced
1 large wedge creamy brie cheese
1/4 cup shredded mozzarella cheese
4 mini multi-grain flatbreads (the size that would be used for a sandwich, not a wrap)
1 generous handful of Spinach/Arugula mix, rinsed
1 1/4 cups cherry tomatoes, halved
About 5 tablespoons olive oil
1/2 tablespoon basil
Cracked black pepper, to tast

Steps:
Starting by heating 1 1/2 tablespoons olive oil in a medium-sized skillet over medium heat. Add onion and minced garlic, saute for about 5 minutes or until slightly caramelized (but not burnt). Tear prosciutto into small pieces and add to skillet. Saute for 8-10 minutes or until prosciutto is crispy. Remove from heat and set aside.<br />

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Remove 3 out of the 5 sides of skin from the wedge of brie cheese with a sharp knife, if desired. (We're not big fans of the skin taste, but you can't remove it all or it'll fall apart.) Slice into thin strips/small pieces.
Spray non-stick cooking spray on a large baking sheet and place mini flatbreads on the sheet. Drizzle flatbreads with olive oil so they are evenly covered but not saturated (a little less than 1 tablespoon per flatbread). Cover flatbreads with brie cheese, about 5-6 small pieces per flatbread, leaving space in between for the cheese to melt. Divide the 1/4 cup mozzarella between the four flatbreads -- sprinkling evenly to fill in the gaps between the pieces of Brie.
