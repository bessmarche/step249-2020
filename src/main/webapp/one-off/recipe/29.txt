Ingredients:
For the dough:
2 &amp; 1/4 teaspoons active dry yeast
1/4 teaspoon + 2/3 cup granulated sugar, divided
1/2 cup warm water
1/2 cup warm milk
1/4 cup butter, melted
1 teaspoon salt
2/3 cup pumpkin puree
6 cups all-purpose flour

For the filling:
2 tablespoons butter, melted
1/4 cup maple syrup
3/4 cup brown sugar, packed
2 tablespoons cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon nutmeg

For the glaze:
4 cups powdered sugar
1/2 teaspoon vanilla
1 &amp; 1/2 teaspoons maple extract
7 tablespoons mil

Steps:
1. In a large bowl, stir together the yeast, 1/4 teaspoon granulated sugar, and warm water. Allow to proof for 5-10 minutes, or until the yeast becomes foamy. If the yeast does not foam, discard and start over with new yeast.<br />

2. To the same bowl, add the warm milk, butter, sugar, salt, and pumpkin puree and stir well. Add the flour 1/2 cup at a time, until you can no longer stir the dough. Transfer the dough to a lightly floured surface and knead in the remaining flour until the dough is sticky, but does not stick to your hands. For me, this took about 5 minutes, and I used about 5 &amp; 1/2 cups of flour.
3. Transfer the dough to a lightly greased bowl and cover with plastic wrap. Allow the dough to rise in a warm, draft-free area for about two hours, or until doubled in volume.
4. While the dough is rising, combine the melted butter and maple syrup in a small bowl. In a separate bowl, combine the brown sugar, cinnamon and nutmeg. Grease a 9x13-inch pan and an 8x8-inch square dish.
5. Punch down the dough and transfer it to a lightly greased surface. Roll the dough out into a rectangle approximately 12 inches by 24 inches. Using a pastry brush or small spatula, spread the butter and syrup mixture evenly over the surface of the dough. Sprinkle the brown sugar and spice mixture evenly over the moistened surface, and gently press it into the dough.
6. Roll the dough up as tightly as possible into a log. With a sharp knife, trim about one inch off each end of the log and discard. Cut the log into 16 equal pieces. The easiest way to do this is to cut the log in half, then cut the halves in half, and so on. Carefully transfer the slices to the prepared pans (12 in the large pan, 4 in the small pan) and reshape if necessary. Cover the pans with plastic wrap.
7. Place a baking dish filled with about 1&quot; of boiling water on the bottom rack of a cold oven. Place the covered pans on the top rack of the oven and allow to rise for about one hour, or until almost doubled in size.
8. Remove the pan of boiling water and the risen rolls from the oven and preheat to 350Â°F. Once the oven is heated, remove the plastic wrap from the pans and bake for 20-25 minutes, or until the rolls are golden brown.
