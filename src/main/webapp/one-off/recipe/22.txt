Ingredients:
2 Tablespoons Chipotle Chili Peppers in Adobo Sauce
3 Jalepeno Chicken Sausages, diced
1/2 can Rotel
2 Tablespoons fresh chopped cilantro
1 cup refried beans
3/4 cup shredded colby-jack cheese
4 Tostadas
Chopped green onions and Cholula hot sauce for toppin

Steps:
Preheat oven to 425 degrees F.<br />
Preheat oven to 425 degrees F.
Spray a medium-sized skillet with nonstick spray. Saute chicken sausage over medium heat for 1-2 minutes. Add cilantro, chipotle chili peppers in adobo sauce and Rotel, mix together and saute for an additional 1-2 minutes. Add cilantro, saute for 1 minute, set aside.
Place the refried beans in a bowl, and microwave for 30-60 seconds or until warm. (This helps the beans become a bit more malleable to avoid you breaking a tostada as you smear them on.)
Spray a nonstick baking sheet with nonstick spray. Delicately place 4 tostadas on the sheet and smear a healthy layer of refried beans over each. Top each with about a 1/4 cup of chicken sausage mixture and then with a sprinkle of cheese, dividing the cheese and chicken sausage mixture evenly among the four. Bake for 8-10 minutes or until cheese is melted.
