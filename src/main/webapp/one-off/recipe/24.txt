Bell Pepper and Egg Breakfast

Ingredients:
two eggs
 1 bell pepper (or two if you like different colors)
 shredded cheese
 fresh basil
 green onion
 salt and pepper

Steps:
Wash and cut the bell pepper into &frac12; inch thick rings. Remove the white membranes from the inside. The first time I made this, I cut the rings a bit over half an inch because I wanted the ring to be thick enough to hold in the egg. This will definitely vary depending on the size of egg you use and how big the rings are. Just have fun with it!
Make sure to slice the rings as evenly as you can, with a non-serrated knife. If the rings aren&rsquo;t straight, egg will leak out from underneath when you crack the egg into the ring.
Heat a non-stick pan on medium heat with a tablespoon of olive oil. At the same time, turn on the broiler on the high heat setting. If you can use a pan with a metal handle, do so. You&rsquo;ll see why in a minute.
When the oil is heated, add the bell pepper rings and allow to cook 2-3 minutes. Do not flip. Next, crack one egg into each bell pepper ring and season with salt and pepper. Allow 2-3 minutes to let the bottom of the eggs cook.
Transfer the pepper-egg on top of toast or wheat sandwich thin. Sprinkle a little cheese and green onion on top and serve!
