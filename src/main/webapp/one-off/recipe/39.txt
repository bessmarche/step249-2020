Bacon and Cheese Stuffed Burger

Ingredients:
8oz ground beef (per burger)
 a sprinkle of shredded cheddar cheese
 2 strips roughly chopped turkey bacon (or regular bacon!!)
 1 burger bun
 a ring or two of red onion
 a slice of tomato
 a leaf of lettuce or whatever greens you like on your burg
 mayo
 ketchup

Steps:
Step 1: Fry the turkey bacon and set aside for a few minutes. When they are cool enough, roughly cut the bacon and set aside in a bowl.
Step 2: Sprinkle out the amount of cheese you want for your burger from its original bag into a separate dish. This makes it easier to avoid contamination because you&rsquo;ll be handling the raw meat already when stuffing with bacon and cheese.
Step 3: Get a lid to use as a patty template. (I used the lid of a yogurt container.) Put a sheet of saran wrap over the lid. Divide the 8 ounce beef patty in half. Place the first half on top of the saran wrap.
Step 4: Layer the chopped bacon and cheese on top. It kinda looks like a pizza, doesn&rsquo;t it? Finally place the second half of your beef patty on top of the bacon and cheese. Make sure to seal the outer edges so that the inner filling doesn&rsquo;t bubble out while you cook.
Step 5: In a frying pan, heat about 3-4 tbs of veggie oil on medium. Place the patties in the pan when the oil is hot and let them fry on each side for 5 minutes or until cooked through.
Step 6: While the burgers are doin their thang, toast the hamburger buns and mayo both sides. Slice the tomatoes and cut the onions into rings. I prefer my onions caramelized, so I sauteed these in a separate frying pan while the burgers cooked.
Step 6: When the burgers are cooked, place them on some paper towels to soak up the extra oil then sandwich them between the buns.
