Wash chicken and stuff cavity with more vegetables.  Place in center of crock pot, resting on vegetables, breast side up.  Place remaining vegetables around sides of chicken.  Add one cup of liquid to crock pot, making sure to also pour over chicken.  This allows the seasoning to stick to the chicken.  Add remaining seasoning.
