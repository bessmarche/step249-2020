Ingredients:
3 canned pineapple chunks
 1 pkg of your favorite brand of bacon

Steps:
Step 1: Cut the bacon strips into fourths or halves, depending on how much bacon you like wrapped around the pineapple.
Step 2: Wrap the bacon around the pineapple and secure with a toothpick (or not. We didn&rsquo;t).
Step 3: Plate these on a foil lined tray about an inch apart and place them in the oven at 350 degrees F for about 15-25 minutes or until the bacon is as nice and crispy as you desire.
