Ingredients:
2 thick strips smokey bacon, cut into lardons 
1/2 small head cauliflower, cut into florets
1/2 lb brussels sprouts, trimmed and large ones halved
s&p
cayenne 
2 tbsp maple syru

Steps:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F.<br />
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F.
Fry bacon in a large cast iron pan over medium heat until most of the fat is rendered (and the bacon is crispy), about 5 minutes. Transfer bacon to paper towel-lined plate using a slotted spoon.  Add brussels sprouts and cauliflower to rendered bacon fat.  Season with s&p (don't use too much salt because you will be adding the salty bacon back in).  Saute, stirring occasionally, until golden brown, about 5-6 minutes.  Sprinkle with cayenne to taste (we used between 1/4 and 1/2 tsp).  Toss to combine.
Roast brussels sprouts and cauliflower mixture 10 minutes.  Remove from oven, add maple syrup and bacon.  Stir to combine.  Return the pan to the oven and roast for another 10 minutes.
